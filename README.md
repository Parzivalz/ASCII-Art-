# ASCII-Art
VERY OLD PROJECT
This mini project in Python 3 converts any image into ASCII Art.

In this project, I use a variety of libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow">PIL</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/">Colorama</a> to make a creative and cool ASCII Art generator.
